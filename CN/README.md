# Computer Networks Laboratory â€“ Networking Fundamentals

Practice essential networking concepts and configurations including troubleshooting, LAN simulation, IP addressing and subnetting, routing protocols (RIP, OSPF, EIGRP, RIPng), VLAN setup, and LAN/WAN deployment using both IPv4 and IPv6.

## ðŸ“š Available Experiments

1. [Basic Networking Troubleshooting Commands](./expt_1.md)  
   Learn and use basic networking commands like `ping`, `tracert`, and `ipconfig` to troubleshoot network issues.

2. [Simulation of LAN Topology - HTTP, DNS & DHCP](./expt_2.md)  
   Simulate a LAN environment including services like HTTP web servers, DNS resolution, and DHCP IP assignment.

3. [IP Addressing and Subnetting](./expt_3.md)  
   Understand and implement IP addressing schemes and subnetting for efficient network management.

4. [Static Routing Configuration, Testing, and Troubleshooting](./expt_4.md)  
   Configure and troubleshoot static routes to control network traffic manually between routers.

5. [Dynamic Routing Protocols - RIP V1 & V2](./expt_5.md)  
   Set up, test, and troubleshoot dynamic routing using RIP (Routing Information Protocol) versions 1 and 2.

6. [Dynamic Routing Protocols - OSPF & EIGRP](./expt_6.md)  
   Configure and verify advanced dynamic routing protocols like OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) and EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol).

7. [VLAN Configuration, Testing, and Troubleshooting](./expt_7.md)  
   Design and implement Virtual LANs (VLANs) for improved network segmentation and traffic management.

8. [Simulation of LAN using IPv6](./EX-8/README.md)  
   Explore the next-generation Internet Protocol (IPv6) by simulating a LAN network setup with IPv6 addressing.

9. [Dynamic Routing Protocols - RIPng](./EX-9/README.md)  
   Configure and troubleshoot RIPng (RIP next generation) for routing in IPv6-enabled networks.

10. [LAN and WAN Configuration using Physical Topology](./EX-10/README.md)  
    Deploy and manage both Local Area Networks (LAN) and Wide Area Networks (WAN) based on physical topologies.
