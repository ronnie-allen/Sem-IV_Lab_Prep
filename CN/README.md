Computer Networks Laboratory â€“ Networking Fundamentals

Practice essential networking concepts and configurations including troubleshooting, LAN simulation, IP addressing and subnetting, routing protocols (RIP, OSPF, EIGRP, RIPng), VLAN setup, and LAN/WAN deployment using both IPv4 and IPv6.

ðŸ“š Available Experiments

1. Basic Networking Troubleshooting Commands
Learn and use basic networking commands like ping, tracert, and ipconfig to troubleshoot network issues.


2. Simulation of LAN Topology - HTTP, DNS & DHCP
Simulate a LAN environment including services like HTTP web servers, DNS resolution, and DHCP IP assignment.


3. IP Addressing and Subnetting
Understand and implement IP addressing schemes and subnetting for efficient network management.


4. Static Routing Configuration, Testing, and Troubleshooting
Configure and troubleshoot static routes to control network traffic manually between routers.


5. Dynamic Routing Protocols - RIP V1 & V2
Set up, test, and troubleshoot dynamic routing using RIP (Routing Information Protocol) versions 1 and 2.


6. Dynamic Routing Protocols - OSPF & EIGRP
Configure and verify advanced dynamic routing protocols like OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) and EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol).


7. VLAN Configuration, Testing, and Troubleshooting
Design and implement Virtual LANs (VLANs) for improved network segmentation and traffic management.


8. Simulation of LAN using IPv6
Explore the next-generation Internet Protocol (IPv6) by simulating a LAN network setup with IPv6 addressing.


9. Dynamic Routing Protocols - RIPng
Configure and troubleshoot RIPng (RIP next generation) for routing in IPv6-enabled networks.


10. LAN and WAN Configuration using Physical Topology
Deploy and manage both Local Area Networks (LAN) and Wide Area Networks (WAN) based on physical topologies.
