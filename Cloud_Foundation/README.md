# ☁️ AWS Cloud Computing Lab

Welcome to the **AWS Cloud Computing Laboratory**!  
This lab provides **hands-on experience** with core AWS services like IAM, EC2, VPC, RDS, EBS, Load Balancers, and Auto Scaling.  
You’ll learn how to **build, secure, manage, and scale** cloud infrastructures step-by-step through real-world exercises.
