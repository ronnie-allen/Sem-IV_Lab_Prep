# 🌟 DBMS Laboratory (Database Management System Laboratory) 🌟

The **DBMS Laboratory** is all about diving into the world of databases and unleashing the power of data! 🌐💾 This lab offers exciting, hands-on opportunities to design, implement, and manage both relational and non-relational databases. Whether you're creating tables, running queries, or connecting applications to databases, this lab has got you covered! 🎉💡

### 🚀 Key Exercises and Technologies:
- **SQL DDL and DML Commands**: 🛠️ Create tables, define schemas, and manipulate data like a pro using SQL.
- **Transactions and Triggers**: 🕹️ Manage data consistency with commands like `COMMIT` and `ROLLBACK`, and automate processes with triggers.
- **Normalization**: ✨ Optimize database design by reducing redundancy with normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF, and more).
- **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**: 🤖 Connect Java applications seamlessly to relational databases and execute dynamic queries.
- **PL/SQL Procedures and Functions**: 📦 Write reusable procedures and functions to perform complex database operations with ease.
- **MongoDB CRUD Operations**: 🗄️ Explore schema-less, flexible collections with Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.
- **Set Operations and Joins**: 🧩 Combine datasets effectively using SQL JOINs and set operations like `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT`.
