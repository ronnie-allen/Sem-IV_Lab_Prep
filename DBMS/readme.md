# DBMS Laboratory (Database Management System Laboratory)

The DBMS Laboratory equips students with practical skills in designing, implementing, and managing both relational and non-relational databases. This laboratory is structured with foundational and advanced exercises, covering topics such as schema creation, data manipulation, query optimization, normalization, and integration with programming languages like Java and MongoDB. Students are encouraged to apply SQL and NoSQL operations to solve real-world database problems effectively.

### Key Exercises and Technologies Include:
- **SQL DDL and DML Commands**: Managing database schemas, creating tables, defining constraints, and performing essential data operations.
- **Transactions and Triggers**: Implementing `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, and triggers for enforcing data integrity and automation.
- **Normalization**: Enhancing database efficiency by reducing redundancy and eliminating anomalies through 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF, and beyond.
- **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**: Bridging Java applications with relational databases for programmatic data processing.
- **PL/SQL Procedures and Functions**: Writing modular, reusable blocks to streamline database operations and handle exceptions.
- **MongoDB CRUD Operations**: Managing data in a NoSQL database using flexible and schema-less collections.
- **Set Operations and Joins**: Combining, filtering, and grouping datasets using SQL JOINs and set operations such as `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT`.

## **Exercise List**

1. **[EX-1: Creating and Managing Tables](./expt_1.md)**  
   - **Focus**: Define schemas, create tables, add/modify columns, drop tables, and truncate data effectively.

2. **[EX-2: TCL and DCL Commands](./expt_2.md)**  
   - **Focus**: Implement transaction controls (`COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`) and manage access privileges with `GRANT` and `REVOKE`.

3. **[EX-3: SQL Set Operations](./expt_3.md)**  
   - **Focus**: Use `UNION`, `UNION ALL`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT` to combine and filter query results.

4. **[EX-4: SQL JOIN Operations](./expt_4.md)**  
   - **Focus**: Retrieve data across multiple tables using `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL OUTER JOIN`, and `CROSS JOIN`.

5. **[EX-5: SQL Triggers](./expt_5.md)**  
   - **Focus**: Automate actions and validate data consistency using triggers like `BEFORE INSERT`, `BEFORE UPDATE`, and `BEFORE DELETE`.

6. **[EX-6: PL/SQL Procedures and Functions](./expt_6.md)**  
   - **Focus**: Write reusable procedures and functions to perform advanced database operations and error handling.

7. **[EX-7: Aggregate and Built-in Functions](./expt_7.md)**  
   - **Focus**: Utilize SQL functions such as `SUM`, `COUNT`, `MAX`, and `MIN`, and explore string, numeric, and date functions.

8. **[EX-8: JDBC Integration](./expt_8.md)**  
   - **Focus**: Connect Java applications to relational databases, execute SQL queries, and process results programmatically.

9. **[EX-9: MongoDB CRUD Operations](./expt_9.md)**  
   - **Focus**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations in a MongoDB database and manage schema-less collections.

10. **[EX-10: Normalization and Denormalization](./expt_10.md)**  
    - **Focus**: Apply normalization techniques from 1NF to BCNF to reduce redundancy while understanding trade-offs in denormalization.
